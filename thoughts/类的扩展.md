### 类的扩展

语法长这样：

```
@interface XYZPerson ()

@property NSObject *extraProperty;

@end
```

一般我们是用它来舍子私有的属性和方法。写在.m头内。

> An extension is best for private methods which you would like to declare in your .m file. I use it for this all the time. Categories are more useful when you want to group your methods into different sections — categories :) — or when you want to add code to existing classes that you didn't create


注意OC的class Extension 与 Swift的 Extension 完全不一样:

class extension in OC = private funcs/properties in Swift

Swift Extension ≈ OC Category 扩展一个类，添加一些方法
